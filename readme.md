## A multitask neural network for activity recognition.

This is the implementation of multitask neural network for activity recognition.
The main task is to learn from very limited labeled data and lots of unlabeled data, while transferring knowledge from existing information.
This is a supplementary material for my submission for Korean Database Conference 2018.

Please refer to [jindongwang]( https://github.com/jindongwang/activityrecognition/tree/master/code/percom18_stl)'s work for the dataset and feature extraction method.
